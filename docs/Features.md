## MTA (Mail Transfer Agent ) POSTFIX 
<p align="justify">
Postfix has been selected as the MTA in copper solution due to some of following advantages we found in postfix. To allow the server to send external emails, an MTA such as Sendmail, Postfix, or Exim is required. Mail is read either through direct access (shell login) or mailbox protocols like POP and IMAP. 
Postfix If you compare mail servers, then Postfix should be included, too, because it is also a popular mail server. It is a better mail server because it supports most of the current innovations in a modern-day mail server including but not limited to: • Virtual domains • SMTP relay • Consultation of SMTP client on its whitelist, grey list and blacklist databases • Host and user masquerading • Delivery to mailboxes with Maildir format As you compare mail servers, you will observe that Postfix utilises two large monolithic configuration files instead of the multiple task-oriented configuration files. You will then have to learn a single set of configuration file keywords. So we selected postfix considering It's popularity in integration projects and adaptability with new featues too.
