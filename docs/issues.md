## Spoofing.
<p align="justify">
Email spoofing is one of the best known spoofs. Since core SMTP fails to offer authentication, it is simple to forge and impersonate emails. Spoofed emails may request personal information and may appear to be from a known sender. Such emails request the recipient to reply with an account number for verification. The email spoofer then uses this account number for identity theft purposes, such as accessing the victim’s bank account, changing contact details and so on.” [https://www.techopedia.com/definition/5398/spoofing]

## Transport encryption
<p align="justify">
Transport encryption means that the email(s) will be encrypted when they are send (transferred) from one server to another. The emails are send through an encrypted tunnel when using this method. The emails are encrypted when the depart from one server and decrypted when the arrive on the other server. All emails on the server are not encrypted when they are stored on the server. Sending encrypted emails over the internet you would use for example the POP3S email transfer protocol with the Transport Layer Security (TLS)network protocol (which is the new name for the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol used for quite some years now).
